## AZURE COGNITIVE SERVICES
- Defn: family of AI Services & APIs to help build intelligent apps i.e.: get started quickly, easy,resplonsible development & deployment
- Enables accsss to multiple AI Services with an API Key and Endpoint

**Service Types:**
1. Decision : Anomaly detector, content moderator, personaliser
2. Language : Language understanding, QnA Maker, Text Analytics, Transalator
3. Speech : Speech to Text, Text to Speech, Speech traslation, Speaker recognition
4. Vision : Computer vision, custom vision, face detect
   
#### 1. Knowledge Mining
- Combination of intelligent services t0 quickly learn from vast amounts of information
**Steps**
- Ingest : get content(structured or unstructured) from sources
- Enrich : with AI capabilities that let you extract information, find patterns 
- Explore : via search, bots, applications, data visulization

**Use Cases:**
- Content research: organizations need to review & research technical data
- Auditing, Risk, Compliamnce Management : help identify entities of importance from documents & flag important ideas
- Business Process Management : automate
- Customer Support & feedback analysis: find answer for a customer inquiry
- Digital asset management : search index documents
- Contract management :

#### 2. Face Service
- Provides AI algos that detect, recognize, and analyze human faces in images
- Azure Face can detect: faces in an image, faces with specific attributes, face landmarks, similar faces, same face as a specific identity
  
#### 3. Speech & Translate Service
- Azure Translate Service : Uses Neural machine translation
                          : Custom translator  to extend service based on business domain
- Azure Speech Service : speech synthesis service
  Features:
     Speech to Text: real time, batch speech to text, multi device conversation, conversation transcription
     Text to Speech : uses speech synthesis markup languge
     Voice Assistance : integrates with Bot framework sdk
     Speech recognition :  speaker verification & identification
   

#### 4. Text Analytics
NLP for text mining and analysis
1. Sentiment analysis : apply labels and confidence score to text at sentence and document level
2. Opinion mining : when provided with more granular data with a subject and opinion tied to a seniment
3. Key phrase extraction : identify main concepts in text, works best with larger amounts of text
4. Language detection
5. Named Entity Recognition : detect words and phrases mentioned in unstructured data that can be associated with a semantic type ie: location, age, events, person, diagnosis
#### 5. OCR Computer Vision
- Extracting text  into a digital format
Azure has 2 APIs:
1. OCR API - older, only images, executes synchronously, better for less text, more languages,easier to implement
2. Read API - newer model, images and PDFs, executes asynchronously,  more text, fewer languages, difficult to implement

OCR uses computer vision SDK

#### 6. Form Recognizer  
- Specialized OCR service that preserves structure and relationship of form-like data
- It can identify : key-value pairs, selection marks, table structures
- Outputs: original file relationships, bounding box, confidence scores
Composed of : 
   - Custom models - trained with your own data. Two learning options: train without labels, train with labels
   - Pre-built models for invoices, receipts, business cards, IDs
   - The Layout models
#### 7. LUIS
Language Understanding - no-code ML service to build natural language into apps
Composed of a schema that is autogenerated which defines:
- Intentions - WHat user is asking for: Has NONE intention
- Entities - What parts of the intent is used to determine the answer
- Utterances - examples of user input that includes intent & entities to train ML model match predictions against real user input
  
#### 8. QnA Maker
- Enables conversational layer over your data based on knowledge base
  
  **Features**:
- Knowledge base : Imports content into a knowledge base of Question-Answer pairs. Stores text in mArkdown
- Chatbox : platform to converse with bot
- Chitchat : allows addition of a pre-populated set of the top chit-chat into knowledge based. Has about 100
- Layered Ranking System: data is stored in azure search(1st ranking layer), top results are passed into QnA Maker NLP re-ranking model to produce the final results and confidence score
- Multi-turn conversation : follow -up prompts and context to manage the multiple turns from one question to another
  
**Use cases:**
When you 
- Have Static Info : 
- Provide the same answer to a repeat request 
- Want to filter static info based on meta-information
- Manage a bot conversation that includes static info
#### 8. Azure Bot Service
- Used for creating, publishing and managing bots
  
**Bot framework SDK**
- Open source SDK that enables developers model and build sophisticated conversations
- Bot framework composer : open source IDE to author, test, provision, manage conversational experiences
