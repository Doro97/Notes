### ML CONCEPTS
ML Model - function to calculate an ouput based on one or more input variables

**Types of ML Models**
1. Supervised - training data has both features and labels
2. Unsupervised - training data has features only. Discovers patterns, relationships among features
3. Deep Learning - create artificial neural networl that emulate human brain

**Supervised ML Models**
1. Regression models - the predicted output is a numeric value
   Algorithms:
   Evaluation Metrics :
    - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
    - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
    - Root MSE (RMSE)
    - R-squared 
3. Classification - the label represents a class or categorization
   Algorithms :
   - Binary classification : Logistic Regressison
   - Multi-class classification : One vs Rest Algorithm, Multinomial Algorithm
   Evaluation Metrics :
   - Confusion matrix : no of incorrect and correct predictions for each class label
   - Accuracy : proportions of predictions the model got right
   - Precision : proportion of predicted +ve cases where the actual label is true
   - Recall : proportion of +ve cases identified correctly
   - F1 Score : mean of recall and precision
   - AUC : how well the model distinguishes between classes

**Unsupervised ML Models**
1. Clustering - identifies similarities between observations based on their features and groups them into discrete clusters
   Algorithms :
   - K-means clustering
   Evaluation Metrics :
   - Average distance to cluster center
   - Average distance to other
   - Max distance to cluster center
   - Silhouette

5. Foundry Tools : prebuilt ML models for common tasks ie: object detection, accessible via APIs
6. Auto ML : automates algorithm selection, hyperparameter tuning. Tasks supported: regression, classification, time-series forecasting, computer vision, NLP
   

### GEN AI CONCEPTS
1. Language Model - encapsulate the linguistic & semantic relationships between words & phrases
2. Prompt - input given to a language model to generate a response
3. System Prompt - define model's behaviour, tone, constraints
4. User Prompt - specific instructions for the model
5. Conversational History - gen ai apps maintain history to provide context
6. RAG - add external context
7. Embedding - learned vector representation of tokens with semantic meaning
8. Attention - mechanism that weighs token relationships to capture context
9. Multi-head attention - evaluates multiple elements of the token in parallel to improve efficiency


**Steps to train an LLM**
1. Tokenization - break down text into tokens and each token is assigned a unique ID
2. Initial Vector Assignment - each token ID is mapped to an initial vector(numeric array)
3. Positional Encoding - add positional information to the token vectors so that the model knows the order of tokens
4. Transformer Encoding (embedding creation) - pass the token vectors, with positional encoding through a transformer encoder which uses attention to learn relationships between tokens in context. This produces embeddings(vectors  that capture lingistic and semantic meaning)
5. Transformer Decoding (prediction) - the decoder uses embeddings and attention to predict the next token in a sequence, refining weights through training iterations

**The Transformer Model**
1. Encoder - creates embeddings with attention. The attention layer examines each token in turn and determines how it is influenced by tokens around it. Using multi-head attention, it assigns weights that can be used to calculate  the new vector element values. The result of this layer is fed into a fully connected neurl netwrok to find the best vector representation of the embedding
2. Decoder - uses embeddings from encoder to determine the next most probable token in a sequence. Uses attention and Feed-Forward neural network to make predictions
